# IATI_data
This repository includes code, sample files and a walkthrough notebook with text explanations and code snippets that you can use. It's really aimed at folk who want to tidy up the data and make it easier to analyse. 

The notebook opens in Jupyter or Google Colabs - Colabs is easier if you are just starting out: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb

If you are an advanced python user, check out some of the other IATI Github repositories, such as https://github.com/codeforIATI

To get the initial data in a CSV format, I'd recommend using the IATI Querybuilder at http://datastore.iatistandard.org/query/ - I'll include a tutorial for that soon.
