# IATI_data
This repository is based on code written with Python's Pandas software library https://pandas.pydata.org/ which is used for tabular data manipulation and analysis. Pandas is really good for working with openly available datasets in CSV or JSON format, and can be used together with Excel. 

This repository includes a walkthrough notebook: IATI_DFID_DATA.ipynb which has text explanations and basic Pandas code snippets that you can use to get started.

I'm using Pandas to work with IATI-standardised aid data, but it can be used for any kind of spreadsheet or JSON data . The code I create is really aimed at folk who want to quickly tidy up datasets they are working with and make them easier to analyse. 

If you have a Github account, you can copy or 'fork' this repository by clicking on 'Use this template' green button - more info here https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo.

You can also download all the files onto your computer by clicking on the 'clone or download' button and choose to download a Zip file.

The notebook opens in Jupyter or Google Colabs for those with Google accounts - my experience is that Colabs is easier if you are just starting out: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb. If Github is showing an error message for the notebook, then you can see it via Juypter's viewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sj21446/IATI_data/blob/master/IATI_DFID_DATA.ipynb

If you are interested in using IATI data yourself, I'd recommend that you get the initial data in a CSV format by using IATI Querybuilder at http://datastore.iatistandard.org/query/ - I'll include a tutorial for that soon.

If you are an advanced python user and want to use IATI data, check out some of the other IATI Github repositories, especially https://github.com/codeforIATI as you are likely to find what you need there.
