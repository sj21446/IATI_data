# IATI_data
This repository includes code written with Python's Pandas software library which is used for data manipulation and analysis. The repository includes a walkthrough notebook: IATI_DFID_DATA.ipynb with text explanations and Pandas code snippets that you can use with data.

I'm using this Pandas code to work with IATI data, but it can be used for any kind of data. It's really aimed at folk who want to quickly tidy up datadsets they are working with and make them easier to analyse. 

The notebook opens in Jupyter or Google Colabs - my experience is that Colabs is easier if you are just starting out: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb, although I do also use Juptyer via Anaconda.

If you are an advanced python user, check out some of the other IATI Github repositories, especially https://github.com/codeforIATI as you are likely to find what you need there.

If you are interested in using IATI data yourself, I'd recommend that you get the initial data in a CSV format by using IATI Querybuilder at http://datastore.iatistandard.org/query/ - I'll include a tutorial for that soon.
